# landing-page-2

Project: Landing Page - The Odin Project CSS Foundations Course. Attempt #2.

I have added two revisions of the first landing page, experimenting with HTML layout using different properties including main, section & wrapper to see if I can achieve a similar outcome. additional files include index-alternative.html & style-alternative.css
