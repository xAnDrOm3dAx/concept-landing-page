The Odin Project- Flexbox

Project: Landing Page - attempt 2

Technologies Used: HTML & CSS

Introduction: This project involved building a clone of an existing static, non-responsive landing page. I have added two versions of the landing page, experimenting with HTML layout to see if I can achieve a similar outcomes using different properties. Additional files include index-v2.html & style-v2.css

You can access Version 2 by clicking the 'Version 2' link in the nav bar (top right). In the v2 html, I implemented the use of div wrappers to define width and center my containers.
